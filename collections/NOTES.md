# Collections

Rust standard library includes useful data structures called _collections_

These standard library collections are implemented using heap memory which
means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can
change dynamically

Common collections:
- _vector_: variable sequence of values
- _string_: collection of characters
- _hash map_: key-value collection 
  - a more particular implementation of of the general data structure _map_
